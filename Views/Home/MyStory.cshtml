                <div class="timeline-content">
                    <p>Five years into my life, it was already clear that I was an academic achiever. As a kinder, I loved participating in class, had a bright personality, and was always 'bibo'. Even as a kid, I knew that I loved talking to people. Despite being an introvert, my mother nurtured me to join contests; a core memory of mine is joining my first-ever storytelling contest when I was five. I storytold 'The Monkey and the Turtle.' I did not win, but I was so proud of myself for taking that opportunity. Unfortunately, the pink outfit I wore to that contest was lost—and it was the first time I had worn it! I remember crying so hard when I lost it.

                <div class="timeline-content">
                    <p>Ten years into my life, I was a Grade 5 student. My elementary years were incredibly memorable because it was during this time that I discovered more of who I am. I realized that I wasn’t just limited to academics; I also had a natural talent for leadership. Beyond the classroom, I explored my creative side—learning that I could dance with rhythm, cook with passion, and lend my voice as a member of the school choir. These years also marked my first steps toward independence. I learned how to commute and navigate the way home by myself, finding a sense of maturity in those daily walks. These experiences taught me the fundamental basics of life: responsibility, teamwork, and the joy of discovering hidden talents. I began to see myself not just as a student, but as a person with many different layers.

                <div class="timeline-content">
                    <p>When 2020 arrived, I was fifteen years old. High school was tough, but I truly enjoyed the journey. My routine consisted of waking up early and heading home in the late afternoon, followed by hours of assignments and projects. While I focused heavily on my academics, I also discovered new hobbies that became my escape—I fell in love with listening to K-pop and watching K-dramas.
                    As I got older, I felt the weight of the future; I was confused about what path to pursue because I felt like I wanted to be everything at once. Despite that uncertainty, I made wonderful friends who made the journey easier. One of my favorite memories was our trip to Enchanted Kingdom, where we laughed, screamed on the rides, and forgot about our school stress for a day. It was a time of growth, friendship, and self-discovery

                <div class="timeline-content">
                    <p>Now, in 2026, I am turning twenty-one. I am here today, truly embracing this chapter of my life. While I am still navigating the hurdles and challenges of adulthood, I am learning to enjoy the process of self-discovery. This 'coming of age' journey is about more than just growing older; it’s about overcoming obstacles, exploring new horizons, and staying true to the girl who once storytold 'The Monkey and the Turtle' when she was five. Today, I am storytelling my life through this digital diary. I am ready for whatever comes next, and I am making sure to record and cherish every memory of the things that happen in my life.

                    <p>Looking ahead, my heart is set on a life without limits. I want to travel the world, documenting every landscape and culture I encounter through the lens of my own experiences. I aspire to write stories that resonate and create music that captures the emotions words cannot reach. More than anything, I want to embrace every adventure that comes my way. I see myself going wherever my curiosity leads, refusing to be defined by just one path. I simply want to be whatever I want myself to be—a storyteller, a creator, and an explorer of life.
